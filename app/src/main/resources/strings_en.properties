introscene_text = Long ago, no one went down into the cellars of the Antique Cabinet; they were abandoned and forgotten. Maybe because there was nothing valuable there, and maybe vice versa. They say that somewhere on the lower floors of the basements once, even before the Invasion, the Charter of the Grammar School disappeared, a book in which the goals of creation and the tradition of the Grammar School were described. Without it, life in the Grammar school went downhill, gradually began to fade and grow dim under the influence of external forces.\n\nYou personally never dreamed of going in search of the Charter, but here you are. You cannot get out - even standing on tiptoes, you will not be able to reach the edges of the hole in the floor of the Antique Library, where you fell. You have one way ahead - down. And let's hope that it ends successfully.

story_sewers = upper levels of basement are located right below the Antique Library and although officially nobody keeps books here for a long time, several ancient volumes can be found only here .

### REMOVED CONTENT <
story_caves=The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
story_metropolis=Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
story_halls=In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\n Very few adventurers have ever descended this far...
